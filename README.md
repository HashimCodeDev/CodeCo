### Project Description

A wild and unhinged virtual girlfriend simulator built with Electron that brings digital companionship to your desktop with questionable life choices.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

People are getting too much real human interaction and need a way to practice awkward conversations with an AI that judges their life decisions.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

We've created a desktop application that simulates having a virtual girlfriend who's probably more dramatic than any real relationship you've ever had!
